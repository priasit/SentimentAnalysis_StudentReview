Our sports teams are amazing, and we do very well in competitions and
games against other schools. The fitness program is great, and we are
required to take PE for at least two years as a class, unless involved
in a school sport.We have a lot of school support, and I mean a lot. I
am very proud of our school.

The school administration is great and they do a great job making sure
that the school is safe for students. The staff is very helpful.
Bullying is not tolerated, and there is always a place to go if you need
help.

Serious things are taken seriously. Non serious things are not. As it

Councilors are helpful, especially since we have such a large school
population. Schools facilities are constantley being improved. The
negative is the condition of the fields for sports. For a high school
that has a lot of students pulling sport scholarships in Field Hockey,
girls soccer, boys soccer, the fields are in horrible condition. My
parents went to Los Gatos High School in the 1980s and played sports on
the same fields with the holes, lack of good grass, areas that flood. We
have no turf fields. Priorities are off on this

Would like to see technology utilized more. I used it a lot in middle
school, but not in high school.

I think that both marijuana and alcohol abuse need to be addressed more
where students see what it does to your brain

Cheating and use of recreational drugs are far more abused than the

I have grown so much and have felt supported in whatever I chose to do,
whether academically or with sports. The teachers go above and beyond to
help you understand a concept.

I feel more prepared for college than the real world; LGHS has amazing
academics, not so great reality checks.

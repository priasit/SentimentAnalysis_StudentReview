What I enjoyed most about my four years at Palo Alto High school was
the sense of community that is felt throughout campus While the courses
are demanding and rigorous the student body works together in a strong
and productive way that always took me by surprise There were always
studentled activities going on somewhere on campus and there was not
one moment when I was bored or felt disconnected from my peers My high

My time at Palo Alto High School has been a very positive experience
One of the things I love most is the amount of spirit and pride that the
students have Our annual Spirit Week brings the students together and
shows just how dedicated we are to our class The students compete to
see who can dress up the best and I have received so many comments from
people that go to other schools wondering how we have such a high
participation It is not often that you find a school with such spirit
and I am proud to have been a part of it
In addition the education at Palo Alto High School has definitely
prepared me for the future The teachers and administration provide all
of the resources necessary to figuring out what each student wants to do
with their lives and the path they want to take While the school is
pretty competitive it acts to drive students to be the best they can

I went to Palo Alto High School for four years and I think that its a
great community Big stress on academic readiness for colleges Grades
are dependent on which teacher you get Counselors are there to support
but only if you approach them There are small traditions like the

This is waaaaaaay to subjective Like most places this school is what
you make of it There is a lot of ambition here because parent AND
student expectations are so high which has good and bad consequences
In some circles there is definitely rampant cheating and school
policies have softened with regard to that behavior and there has been
studentstudent sabotage Still the admin is the worst part of this
school The other adults teachers and health professionals are pretty
receptive to students but my experience and that of several of my
peers with the admin actively discourages student efforts You want to
change a class or ask about credits on a transcript Be prepared for a
long wait which your guidance counselor will probably spend at Peets
Coffee and Tea and will have you in and out of the tower building with
each canceled meeting The college and career center people are not
geared towards helping you in anyway and many people just end up
getting a private advisor or doing it on their own That said the fact
that our alumni go on to great school and accomplish so much is even
more admirable considering this faculty This schools culture of
achievement means we have a lot of people who want to get things done
be that in volunteering science journalism clubs sports or art In
terms of preparing you for life this school has been amazing as you
learn to manage stress and seek out opportunities in there are many in
this area You can find a group of people who you belong with fairly
easily and in general this school is a pretty accepting place

Like any school there will be amazing teachers and horrible ones The
amazing thing about Palo Alto High School is that the horrible teachers
are in the minority and are often found teaching the classes where
students can easily selfteach themselves the material With an
unbelievable amount of funding Palo Alto teachers are able to
interweave technology with the coursework and bring in entertaining
guests and schedule fun activities

The teachers at this school are some of the schools best attributes
Many of them are highly qualified care genuinely about what they teach
and encourage you to do the same Almost every teacher I have had here
has put in effort to engage students and drawn student attention to
opportunities in their area of interest Occasionally grading can seem
unfair or subjective especially within the english department but in
general this is pretty unavoidable If you ask the teachers for help
during tutorial or in class they are for the most part willing to help
you improve I really like lecture style courses which I know some
people find boring but I have still been exposed to a healthy ratio of
handson and project based teaching approaches Presentation and
communication skills are really developed though you dont really
notice this until you listen to how awkward some professional talk are
Basically you are one step ahead The science teachers in particular
those that are known for being tough are amazing They are wonderful at
addressing questions and communicating content that is often beyond the
typical high school comprehension level Failing is pretty much
impossible if you actually put in effort and talk to you teachers
Teachers are really not the issue here

Palo Alto High School Paly is a very accepting high school full of
talented and intelligent individuals We have received lots of criticism
in the past in regards to the competitive nature at our high school but
I believe that the teachers and administration are doing there best to
support the students All the teachers and administrators are very
accessible and helpful and they provide any support academic or
emotional when needed The competitive nature at our school arises from
the students themselves because everyone is so motivated to succeed so
everyone is doing their best be it in classes athletics or clubs
Another thing that surprised me was the amazing school spirit Our
football and basketball games have a decent student attendance but
regardless of the number of people in the crowd the crowd still goes
wild Our spirit is especially portrayed during our spirit week where
all the classes compete against one another

As a minority PALY was a very interesting school it was very fit
towards a specific group of students and because of that some students
slipped through the cracks I did love the school spirit and culture
around specific sports being on the soccer team you were already into a
brotherhood that was very special so PALY had its ups and its downs I
believe they should change the way they find diversity get more colored
or diverse teachers so the diverse students feel they have someone they
can connect to and really just speak to about problems they may have

Palo Alto High School Paly is a very accepting high school full of
talented and intelligent individuals We have received lots of criticism
in the past in regards to the competitive nature at our high school but
I believe that the teachers and administration are doing there best to
support the students All the teachers and administrators are very
accessible and helpful and they provide any support academic or
emotional when needed The competitive nature at our school arises from
the students themselves because everyone is so motivated to succeed so
everyone is doing their best be it in classes athletics or clubs
Another thing that surprised me was the amazing school spirit Our
football and basketball games have a decent student attendance but
regardless of the number of people in the crowd the crowd still goes
wild Our spirit is especially portrayed during our spirit week where
all the classes compete against one another

slipped through the cracks I did love the school spirit and culture
around specific sports being on the soccer team you were already into a

Paly is great because of the number of opportunities and variety for
students Too often students feel like they have to do everything
available which often results in students overloading their schedules
and feeling stressed out Faculty has done some work to discourage this
behavior but it is really not their fault Paly has superior academic
opportunity and rigor but students need to learn that they dont have
to do anything

This is waaaaaaay to subjective Like most places this school is what
you make of it There is a lot of ambition here because parent AND
student expectations are so high which has good and bad consequences
In some circles there is definitely rampant cheating and school
policies have softened with regard to that behavior and there has been
studentstudent sabotage Still the admin is the worst part of this
school The other adults teachers and health professionals are pretty
receptive to students but my experience and that of several of my
peers with the admin actively discourages student efforts You want to
change a class or ask about credits on a transcript Be prepared for a
long wait which your guidance counselor will probably spend at Peets
Coffee and Tea and will have you in and out of the tower building with
each canceled meeting The college and career center people are not
geared towards helping you in anyway and many people just end up
getting a private advisor or doing it on their own That said the fact
that our alumni go on to great school and accomplish so much is even
more admirable considering this faculty This schools culture of
achievement means we have a lot of people who want to get things done
be that in volunteering science journalism clubs sports or art In
terms of preparing you for life this school has been amazing as you
learn to manage stress and seek out opportunities in there are many in
this area You can find a group of people who you belong with fairly
easily and in general this school is a pretty accepting place

Being a student in the famed Palo Alto School District requires
resiliency We are all under the constant stress of juggling multiple
collegelevel courses extracurriculars perhaps a sport or an
instrument SATs and other exams and evidently parents Students are
consistently trying to outcompete each other a mindset instilled in our
heads since we were first able to communicate It is expected that a
student performs extraordinarily well throughout high school enter a
toptiered university and lead a successful career With this fixed
mindset and numerous activities teens are unable to pursue or even
discover their passions The lack of passion will consequently lead to

As a minority PALY was a very interesting school it was very fit
towards a specific group of students and because of that some students
slipped through the cracks I did love the school spirit and culture
around specific sports being on the soccer team you were already into a
brotherhood that was very special so PALY had its ups and its downs I
believe they should change the way they find diversity get more colored
or diverse teachers so the diverse students feel they have someone they

Palo Alto High School Paly is a very accepting high school full of
talented and intelligent individuals We have received lots of criticism
in the past in regards to the competitive nature at our high school but
I believe that the teachers and administration are doing there best to
support the students All the teachers and administrators are very
accessible and helpful and they provide any support academic or
emotional when needed The competitive nature at our school arises from
the students themselves because everyone is so motivated to succeed so
everyone is doing their best be it in classes athletics or clubs
Another thing that surprised me was the amazing school spirit Our
football and basketball games have a decent student attendance but

The teachers at this school are some of the schools best attributes
Many of them are highly qualified care genuinely about what they teach
and encourage you to do the same Almost every teacher I have had here
has put in effort to engage students and drawn student attention to
opportunities in their area of interest Occasionally grading can seem
unfair or subjective especially within the english department but in
general this is pretty unavoidable If you ask the teachers for help
during tutorial or in class they are for the most part willing to help
you improve I really like lecture style courses which I know some
people find boring but I have still been exposed to a healthy ratio of
handson and project based teaching approaches Presentation and
communication skills are really developed though you dont really
notice this until you listen to how awkward some professional talk are
Basically you are one step ahead The science teachers in particular
those that are known for being tough are amazing They are wonderful at
addressing questions and communicating content that is often beyond the
typical high school comprehension level Failing is pretty much

cliques is acceptable You could be the studying with a group of very
intelligent students in BC Calc during school then a swimmer after
school and then be with the party crowd on the weekends The only issue
is the academic stress and the cheating which results from it

There are a wide variety of different clubs one can choose at Palo Alto
High School There are clubs ranging from DECA to HipHop Club to Acts
of Random Kindness Club to Chinese Club Many people are very invested
in clubs and many teachers support different clubs the only tiny
drawbacks are that there are a few clubs that started and didnt really
go anywhere or became more of a place to hangout instead of an actual club

Paly is great because of the number of opportunities and variety for
students Too often students feel like they have to do everything
available which often results in students overloading their schedules
and feeling stressed out Faculty has done some work to discourage this
behavior but it is really not their fault Paly has superior academic
opportunity and rigor but students need to learn that they dont have
to do anything

This is waaaaaaay to subjective Like most places this school is what
you make of it There is a lot of ambition here because parent AND
student expectations are so high which has good and bad consequences
In some circles there is definitely rampant cheating and school
policies have softened with regard to that behavior and there has been
studentstudent sabotage Still the admin is the worst part of this
school The other adults teachers and health professionals are pretty
receptive to students but my experience and that of several of my
peers with the admin actively discourages student efforts You want to
change a class or ask about credits on a transcript Be prepared for a
long wait which your guidance counselor will probably spend at Peets
Coffee and Tea and will have you in and out of the tower building with
each canceled meeting The college and career center people are not
geared towards helping you in anyway and many people just end up
getting a private advisor or doing it on their own That said the fact
that our alumni go on to great school and accomplish so much is even
more admirable considering this faculty This schools culture of
achievement means we have a lot of people who want to get things done
be that in volunteering science journalism clubs sports or art In
terms of preparing you for life this school has been amazing as you
learn to manage stress and seek out opportunities in there are many in
this area You can find a group of people who you belong with fairly
easily and in general this school is a pretty accepting place

are definitely rigorous but most of the time teachers are there though
it can be a hit and miss Most people go to Town and Country for lunch

Recently a few teachers have decided to try something new to help
students who cheat on tests or homework They created this program
called the Social Justice Pathway where students are not pushed away for
cheating but recognized and shown the way towards a better healthier
academic future

Being a student in the famed Palo Alto School District requires
resiliency We are all under the constant stress of juggling multiple
collegelevel courses extracurriculars perhaps a sport or an
instrument SATs and other exams and evidently parents Students are
consistently trying to outcompete each other a mindset instilled in our
heads since we were first able to communicate It is expected that a
student performs extraordinarily well throughout high school enter a
toptiered university and lead a successful career With this fixed
mindset and numerous activities teens are unable to pursue or even
discover their passions The lack of passion will consequently lead to
feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction a feeling that many of us are
quite too familiar with

Everybody talks about how open and compassionate the Palo Alto High
School community is but racism still exists on campus If youre not

of your own race The vast majority of the school is white and asian so
it often does not feel very diverse

The school is very competitive and you must be good at academics and
organized to do well The sports and athletics are good The teachers
are knowledgeable and there is much chance to succeed You should be
academically confident and be able to the homework easily The class
work is strenuous and difficult at times and can be easy in others Good
food choices across the street Classes are all engaging and easy to
find help after school hours if needed Does have peer tutoring and
other academic services to help students succeed

As a minority PALY was a very interesting school it was very fit
towards a specific group of students and because of that some students
slipped through the cracks I did love the school spirit and culture
around specific sports being on the soccer team you were already into a
brotherhood that was very special so PALY had its ups and its downs I
believe they should change the way they find diversity get more colored
or diverse teachers so the diverse students feel they have someone they
can connect to and really just speak to about problems they may have

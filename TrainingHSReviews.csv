The school as it compares to the rest of California is a very top notch
school However when compared to some of the other high schools in the
area such as Gunn  Palo Alto  Saratoga  Cupertino I feel as though
our students fall short of the academic standards held at the other
schools Our sports are fairly decent but they used to be better

The school is very well funded by parent organizations such as the New
Millenium Foundation and this gives us top notch facilities and
equipments in all our classes Many classes have laptop carts The
library and Computer Science class is decked out with top of the line
desktops Multiple 3D printers across the campus Science Department is
very well funded in terms of lab equipment Industrial Arts has laser
cutters industrial washers etc

A very academic school conjoined with competition between nearly every
student There is always something to show off as it seems here and
students are quite self centered The teachers are excellent mainly if
the student has no learning disabilities AP or not nearly all of the
classes are useful Treatment for students with learning disabilities is
also excellent but due to the competitiveness of the school many of
those with disabilites are not helped Many of the students here feel
obliged to do things or self diagnose themselves to make them feel
ahead The campus is very impressive and is well comparative to a
college building in a college campus Parking and traffic is absolutely
terrible for any school day and near pathetic attempts are made to fix
it The administration is extremely understanding for when there are

Because of my condition of ADHD and without having and medication it is
nearly impossible to pay attention in some classes due to how basic and
boring they are Some although are alright and manageable Most cases I
have to get a tutor that can teach kids like me so it makes me wonder

however I can stay after and I can get teaching personally from the

Los Gatos is already a very safe area so some of the more extreme
safety measures are not as necessary right off the bat In my four
years I never felt unsafe on campus for any reason At any given time
at least one teacher or administrator is usually within view even if
its just in passing and any staff member is willing to say something
if heshe sees something going on which looks like a threat to the

school However when compared to some of the other high schools in the

schools Our sports are fairly decent but they used to be better

Los Gatos is already a very safe area so some of the more extreme
safety measures are not as necessary right off the bat In my four
years I never felt unsafe on campus for any reason At any given time
at least one teacher or administrator is usually within view even if
its just in passing and any staff member is willing to say something
if heshe sees something going on which looks like a threat to the
safety of a student

school However when compared to some of the other high schools in the

Los Gatos is already a very safe area so some of the more extreme
safety measures are not as necessary right off the bat In my four
years I never felt unsafe on campus for any reason At any given time
at least one teacher or administrator is usually within view even if
its just in passing and any staff member is willing to say something
if heshe sees something going on which looks like a threat to the

Students feel pressure at every school but our school makes sure that
the students feel safe and included in the community We are very
accepting of one another despite the insecurities that we all feel at
times

I enjoyed my time at Los Gatos High School In general our school is
open to creativity and change Even though its been said that Los Gatos
is a bubble you can always find diversity in ideas and people if you
are willing and proactive The faculty and classes are for the most
part very interesting and I like the people that surround me

Los Gatos proved itself to be a great place where I felt comfortable to
explore my intellectual and athletic interests as well as anything in
between Though I have seen many flaws within the administration when it
comes to helping students who are not as selfmotivated as I am I
witness constant attempts to improve the school in every aspect and
appreciate what an excellent learning environment it fostered for me

This is a fantastic public school I have two graduates and two current
students and the experience has been excellent for each one of them
There are clubs sports and activities for everyone Academics are top
notch and students are well prepared for college

A lot of school spirit but also a lot of cliches
